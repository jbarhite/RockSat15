initialization function
	- Arduino initialization (e.g. input/output pins)
	- initialize SD card
	- initialize I2C devices

loop function
	- scan over frequencies several times (i.e. ramp voltage up and down over different amounts of time)
		- turn camera on
		- ramp up and down
		- turn camera off
	- reattempt SD card initialization if failed

read magnetometer
	- read values
	- write to SD card

read accelerometer
read gyroscope

ramp up
	- set voltage to minimum value
	- increase voltage gradually over specified period of time
	- read sensors periodically

ramp down
	- set voltage to maximum vlaue
	- decrease voltage gradually over specified period of time

turn camera on
	- cut power to camera
	- activate power to camera
	- press camera button

turn camera off
	- press camera button
	- cut power to camera

write line to mission log
	- write message to mission log, with timestamp

wait
	- delay specified amount of time
	- update timestamp
